# Description
This is Ð° simple show-case where we have exposed simple REST API but at some point stakeholders wants a data grid with pagination (displaying  minor subset of properties). GraphQL makes it super easy to implement this requirement with a lot of flexibility so API consumers can pick which fields want to be served as long as they are supported and defined in the GraphQL schema.

# Setup 
- JDK 19 as baseline  
- Maven 
- MongoDB v4.4 (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Postman as nice to have  (https://www.postman.com/)
- Robo 3T (Robomongo) as nice to have (https://robomongo.org/download) or MongoDB Compass (https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
- Docker 

# Running Local
To Build:
````
mvn clean verify
````
To Run:
````
mvn spring-boot:run
````
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to check Swagger UI API definition. 
- Setting up `demo.initial.data.load` to `true` in `application.properties` will load some sample dummy data on startup. 
- Import postman collection in case you want to check up GraphQL exposed end point.

To spin up MongoDB and Mongo-Express via docker compose:
````
docker compose -f .\docker-infra.yml up -d 
````
To shut it down:
````
docker compose -f .\docker-infra.yml down
````
To format the code base:
````
mvn com.spotify.fmt:fmt-maven-plugin:format
````
Data Volumes are available under: `/dockervolume` 

Happy coding!!!
